My sweetheart my love my heart 💗
How many more days like this will we stay apart 💔
However many they may be I'll never forget the start 🙂‍↕️

Few days from now we first talked 🤔
If i had told you then you might've blocked 👀
But fate will always keep our lives interlocked 🥰

I asked you to be my valentine with nothing else to show 😔
Just a little more and we will sit under the same lights glow 🕯
You will forever be my only one, my snow ❄️

(I need to write more for you I love you my love 🫂, lets have many happy days together mmmmmwaaaah💋)
