In every heartbeat, I hear your name,
A melody that puts the stars to shame.
Through every season, through every storm,
Your love is my shelter, keeping me warm.

I found in you what I never knew I needed—
A love so deep, so true, exceeded
Every dream I'd ever dared to dream,
You are my moonlight, my sunbeam.

So here I stand, with heart in hand,
Hoping you'll always understand—
That in this world of fleeting things,
You are my forever, my everything.

— With all my love, always and forever 💖
